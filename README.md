## A recipe finder app using React and Redux

## TODOs:
 - Complete pagination
 - Modal overflow scroll not working as desired
 - Router history.push() is interfering with modal show/close state
 - Limit results to 5 per instructions
 - A bit of responsiveness cleanup
 - Add main hero image icon per mockup
 - Would like to add a loading spinner for search etc
 - Would prefer more React cleanup time (propTypes etc...)

### Note:  Router history.push() was causing search state issues with the modal so it was commented out.
 - You can test the direct url modal recipe load functionality with this link: https://vast-dusk-55857.herokuapp.com/52966
